## 348.Design Tic-Tac-Toe

Medium

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a *n* x *n* grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing *n* of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.



**Example:**

```
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```



**Follow up:**
Could you do better than O(*n*2) per `move()` operation?

**Solution:**

```java
//Use row and col array, diagonal and anti-diagonal to keep track of the sum of each row and colum.
//Time O(1) Space O(N)
class TicTacToe {

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    int[] rows, cols;
    int diag, antiDiag, n;
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        this.rows = new int[n];
        this.cols = new int[n];
        this.diag = 0;
        this.antiDiag = 0;
        this.n = n;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int value = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        rows[row] += value;
        cols[col] += value;
        if (row == col)
            diag += value;
        if (row + col == n - 1)
            antiDiag += value;
        if (Math.abs(rows[row]) == n || Math.abs(cols[col]) == n|| Math.abs(diag) == n || Math.abs(antiDiag) == n)
            return player;
        return 0;
    }
}
