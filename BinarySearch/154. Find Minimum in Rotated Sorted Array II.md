## 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

Hard

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

- This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

**Solution1:**

```java
//Binary Search based on the comparison between nums[end] and nums[mid];
//Time:O(logN) Worst Case O(N), Space: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
       if (nums == null || nums.length == 0)
            return -1;
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[end] > nums[mid]){
                end = mid;
            }else if (nums[end] < nums[mid]){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                end--;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```
