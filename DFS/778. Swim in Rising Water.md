## 778. Swim in Rising Water

Hard

On an N x N `grid`, each square `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i,j)`.

Now rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(N-1, N-1)`?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation:
 0  1  2  3  4
24 23 22 21  5
12 13 14 15 16
11 17 18 19 20
10  9  8  7  6

The final route is marked in bold.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

**Note:**

1. `2 <= N <= 50`.
2. grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].

**Solution1:**

```java
//Binary Search + DFS + DP(Memorization)
//Time O(N^2log(N)) Space O(N ^ 2)
class Solution {
    
    int[][] dirs = new int[][]{{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
    public int swimInWater(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int start = Math.max(2 * (n - 1), Math.max(grid[0][0], grid[n - 1][n - 1])),
        end = n * (n - 1);
        while (start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (dfs(grid, 0, 0, mid, new Boolean[n][n]))
                end = mid;
            else
                start = mid + 1;
        }
        return start;
    }
    
    public boolean dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int depth, Boolean[][] memo){
        int n = grid.length;
        if (i < 0 || i >= n || j < 0 || j >= n || grid[i][j] == -1 
           || grid[i][j] > depth)
            return false;
        if (i == n - 1 && j == n - 1)
            return true;
        if (memo[i][j] != null)
            return memo[i][j];
        int value = grid[i][j];
        grid[i][j] = -1;
        memo[i][j] = false;
        for (int k = 0; k < dirs.length; k++){
            if (dfs(grid, i + dirs[k][0], j + dirs[k][1], depth, memo)){
                memo[i][j] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        grid[i][j] = value;
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
