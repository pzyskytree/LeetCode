## 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Medium

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```



**Solution1:**

```java
//Dynamic Programming: Time: O(N) Space:O(N). Use dp array to store the max profit in 
//day i, the max difference is related to dp[i - 2] - prices[i - 1], because one day 
//cool down
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        int maxDiff = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 2; i < n + 1; i++){
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], prices[i - 1] + maxDiff);
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 2] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

**Solution2:**

```java
//Finite State Machine: Three State: sell, buy, cool
//Sell can transit from buy + prices[i]
//Buy can transit from oldBuy or cool - prices[i]
//cool can transit from oldCool or sell.
//Time O(N) Space O(1)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int buy = -prices[0], sell = 0, cool = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            int oldBuy = buy;
            buy = Math.max(oldBuy, cool - prices[i]);
            cool = Math.max(sell, cool);
            sell = oldBuy + prices[i];
        }
        return Math.max(sell, cool);
    }
}
```
