## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Hard

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **k**transactions.

**Note:**
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Solution1:**

```java
//Dynamic Programming: Time: O(KN) Space:O(KN). The transaction does not need to be 
//continuous, so we can either do a transaction or get the accumulative profit from the 
//previous day.
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int n = prices.length;
        if (k >= n / 2)
            return quickSolve(prices);
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n];
        for (int i = 1; i < k + 1; i++){
            int maxDiff = dp[i - 1][0] - prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], maxDiff + prices[j]);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
    public int quickSolve(int[] prices){
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
                result += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
