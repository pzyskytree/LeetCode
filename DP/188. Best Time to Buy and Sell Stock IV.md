## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Hard

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **k**transactions.

**Note:**
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Solution1:**

```java
//Dynamic Programming: Time: O(N) Space:O(N). The transaction does not need to be 
//continuous, so we can either do a transaction or get the accumulative profit from the 
//previous day.
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int[][] dp = new int[3][prices.length];
        int n = dp.length, m = dp[0].length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            int maxDiff = dp[i - 1][0] - prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++){
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], maxDiff + prices[j]);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        return dp[2][m - 1];
    }
}
```

**Solution2:**

```java
//Four variables: Time O(N) Space O(1)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int hold1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, hold2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, release1 = 0, release2 = 0;
        for (int p : prices){
            release2 = Math.max(release2, hold2 + p);
            hold2 = Math.max(hold2, release1 - p);
            release1 = Math.max(release1, hold1 + p);
            hold1 = Math.max(hold1, -p);
        }
        return release2;
    }
}
```
