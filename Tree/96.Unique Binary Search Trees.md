Given *n*, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... *n*?

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

**Solution1:**

```java
//Dynamic Program: Try to set every node as root. For every root, calculate number of 
//trees by multiply left and right subtree number and add them up. As for subtree we 
//can treat them as subproblems with few number of nodes.

//Time Complexity: O(N ^ 2)
//Space Complexity: O(N)
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i - 1; j++) {
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - 1 - j];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
