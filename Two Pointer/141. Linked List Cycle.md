## 141. Linked List Cycle

Easy

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it using *O(1)* (i.e. constant) memory?

**Solution1:**

```java
//Two Pointer: Time: O(N) Space: O(1)
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null)
            return false;
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while (fast != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
            if (fast != null)
                fast = fast.next;
            if (fast != null && fast == slow)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
