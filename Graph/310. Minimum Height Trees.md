## 310. Minimum Height Trees

Medium

For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

**Format**
The graph contains `n` nodes which are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You will be given the number `n` and a list of undirected `edges` (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3 

Output: [1]
```

**Example 2 :**

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5 

Output: [3, 4]
```

**Note**:

- According to the [definition of tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)): “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by *exactly* one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
- The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

```
Input:
[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
```

**Solution1:**

```java
//BFS
//Find root from the leaf
//Time O(E + V) Space O(N)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        if (n == 0 || edges == null)
            return result;
        if (n == 1){
            result.add(0);
            return result;
        }
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map = new HashMap<Integer, Set<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++){
            if (!map.containsKey(edges[i][0]))
                map.put(edges[i][0], new HashSet<Integer>());
            if (!map.containsKey(edges[i][1]))
                map.put(edges[i][1], new HashSet<Integer>());
            map.get(edges[i][0]).add(edges[i][1]);
            map.get(edges[i][1]).add(edges[i][0]);
        }
        Set<Integer> leaves = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for (Integer key : map.keySet()){
            if (map.get(key).size() == 1)
                leaves.add(key);
        }
        while (map.keySet().size() > 2){
            Set<Integer> temp = new HashSet<Integer>();
            for (Integer k : leaves){
                int v = map.get(k).iterator().next();
                map.get(v).remove(k);
                if (map.get(v).size() == 1)
                    temp.add(v);
                map.remove(k);
            }
            leaves = temp;
        }
        result.addAll(map.keySet());
        return result;
    }
    
}
```
