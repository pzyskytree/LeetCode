## 802. Find Eventual Safe States

Medium

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is *eventually safe* if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number `K` so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `K` steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has `N` nodes with labels `0, 1, ..., N-1`, where `N` is the length of `graph`.  The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph.

```
Example:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.
```

**Note:**

- `graph` will have length at most `10000`.
- The number of edges in the graph will not exceed `32000`.
- Each `graph[i]` will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range `[0, graph.length - 1]`.

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Solution1:**

```java
//Directed graph with cycle, use dfs + states array to find the cycle. Undirected graph
//use UnionFind
//Time O(V + E) Space O(N)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (graph == null || graph.length == 0)
            return result;
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] states = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if (dfs(i, graph, states))
                result.add(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
    public boolean dfs(int i, int[][] graph, int[] states){
        if (states[i] != 0)
            return states[i] == 2;
        states[i] = 1;
        for (int next : graph[i]){
            if (!dfs(next, graph, states))
                return false;
        }
        states[i] = 2;
        return true;
    }
}
```
